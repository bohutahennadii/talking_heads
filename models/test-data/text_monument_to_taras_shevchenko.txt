Monument to Taras Shevchenko in Ternopil is a monument to the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko in Ternopil. The monument is located in the square to the left of the Ternopil Academic Regional Drama Theatre, which, like the square, is also named after the poet.		The author of the monument (1982) is sculptor Mykola Neveselyi, and the architectural design was made by the then chief architect of Ternopil, Stanislav Kalashnyk[2].	The monument is a bronze seated figure of Taras Shevchenko, mounted on a two-stage grey granite pedestal. The height of the sculpture is 2.8 m and the pedestal is 1.2 m.	The modern monument to Taras Shevchenko in Ternopil is not the first monument to the poet in the city. Earlier, in 1953 (or 1952[1]), there was a monument to Shevchenko in the city park in Ternopil (approximately on the site of the modern monument to Bandera). It was made of fragile material and had no artistic value. Due to the reconstruction of the park in the 1970s, it was demolished[1].
The interpretation of Shevchenko's figure is generally in the traditional vein. The authors of the monument managed to convey the portrait features of a strong-minded person. The elderly poet is depicted in a moment of thought, his shoulders slumped, his head slightly turned to the right, his hands folded on his right knee.	In March 1982, when the All-Union Shevchenko literary and artistic festival ‘In a Free, New Family’ was held, a new monument to Taras Shevchenko was unveiled in the park near the theatre. Although it was supposed to be a sculpture for the lobby of the newly built Oktyabr (now Berezil) Palace of Culture, in order to avoid lengthy approvals in party offices[1].
A monument of monumental art, protection number 33. Opposite the monument is Ternopil School No. 3. There is a tradition of laying flowers by graduates of this school every first September.
